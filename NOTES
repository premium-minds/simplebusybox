The goal here is to make a simple and free build of BusyBox for Android
that does not require root.  It will package the binaries within the
app-lib directory, so that all you have to do is add it to $PATH.

It seems popular to add dropbear ssh client to packages such as this one,
but to me that seems like a slippery slope...why add that and not rsync,
for example?  I intend to limit to just busybox.

...

So, here's roughly how the files in jni/ were manually built.  I started
with configs/android_ndk_defconfig, and customized that a bit, and had
that in .config in a regular PC host build.  Then I run "make", and it
generates the auto-generated .h files, and then I run:

   cp include/applet_tables.h include/applets.h include/autoconf.h \
   include/usage.h include/usage_compressed.h include/NUM_APPLETS.h \
   ~/src/simplebusybox/jni/; cp .config ~/src/simplebusybox/jni/config

So that's where those files came from...

...

Switched to using android-ndk-r10d instead of android-ndk-r8 because even
at android-8 (froyo) it has a few more functions...


XXX - make busybox build under JNI
XXX - figure out how to add things that don't end in .so to the ant build (probably need a custom rule of some sort)
XXX - figure out how to add symlinks or hardlinks to the apk
XXX - make UI that just says "paste export PATH=$PATH:/data/app/blah/lib" or whatever
